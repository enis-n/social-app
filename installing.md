for installing dependencies and the packages,

For backend:
when you clone the project and open in vs code,
in terminal: 
command: dotnet restore
(if this doesn't work then cd API, and dotnet restore)
cd API
dotnet watch run

For frontend:
open new terminal
cd client-app
npm install
npm start

/**************************************************************\
you need to have two(2) terminals open at the same time always 
because we always we need to run backend and the frontend at the same time.
